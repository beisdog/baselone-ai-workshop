Each unit was then deployed as a container on the instrument. The communication between the units is done using events, sent through RabbitMq, which acts as a central messaging bus. The event-driven architecture was also reflected in the development of the application, as well as in the unit and acceptance and integration tests. Mainly asynchronously executed functions were developed and tested. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements was always in view, which was ensured by means of special test frameworks and methods linked to a requirements system.
